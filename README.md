# 100 Days of Code with Python

This is my personal 100 days of code challenge with Python, where I will be committing code daily for the next 100 days. I'll be sharing my progress and learnings on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/yourusername).

## Motivation

The goal of this challenge is to improve my skills and knowledge in Python, and to become a better programmer overall. By committing to code daily, I hope to form a habit of consistent learning and growth.

## Rules

- Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
- Share progress daily on GitHub.
- Code using Python for at least an hour each day.
- Complete a project or learn a new concept each week.

## Progress

I'll be updating my progress daily on [GitHub](https://github.com/Adithya-Sakaray/100-Days-of-Code-Python), and you can follow along to see what I'm working on and what I'm learning. 

## Conclusion

I'm excited to embark on this 100 days of code journey with Python, and I hope to come out of it as a better programmer.
